# Python - Server-Side Rendering

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concepts of server-side rendering and how it differs from client-side rendering.
- Learn the benefits of using server-side rendering in web development.
- Implement SSR in Python using the Flask framework.
- Utilize Jinja templating engine to dynamically generate HTML pages.
- Read and display data from various sources including JSON, CSV, and SQLite databases.
- Handle dynamic content and user inputs in web applications.

## What to Expect
In this project, you will build a Flask application that serves web pages using server-side rendering techniques. You will start by creating basic templates and gradually move towards integrating dynamic content from multiple data sources. By the end of the project, you will have a comprehensive understanding of SSR, templating, and how to build efficient, scalable web applications.
